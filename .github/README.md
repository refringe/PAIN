# P.A.I.N. - Painstaking Agony Induced Nuisance

This is a mod for [Single Player Tarkov](https://www.sp-tarkov.com/).

Remember the good ol' days? When Tarkov had hair on its chest? When every raid was a true lesson and every piece of loot was a mystery waiting to be solved?

Somehow, our PMCs became walking encyclopedias, instantly recognizing every screw, optic, and pack of croutons in the city. Real PMCs are forged in ignorance and uncertainty. They don't just find loot; they identify, study, and master it.

Fear not, we've bottled that classic experience for you; it's P.A.I.N. â€” Painstaking Agony Induced Nuisance.

It's time to separate the PMCs from the tourists. If you can't tell a Salewa from a bottle of saline without looking, you haven't earned the right to use it. **Embrace the P.A.I.N.**

# Features:
- Forgetting what an AI-2 looks like for the tenth time.
- Is that a magazine or a bannana? You'll never reload until you know!
- Making you truly earn the knowledge that a T-Plug is, in fact, not a weapon.
- The joy of discovering that you can't repair a broken leg with a splint, because you don't know what it looks like.

# To Build Locally:

This project has been built in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSC) using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). If you are unfamiliar with Node.js, I recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage installation and switching versions. If you do not wish to use NVM, you will need to install the version of Node.js listed within the `.nvmrc` file manually.
